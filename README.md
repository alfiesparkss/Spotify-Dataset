This graph shows that the most popular songs are generally characterized by high danceability and moderate to high energy levels, indicating that upbeat and rhythm-driven tracks dominate listener preferences. Artists like Ariana Grande and Post Malone appear multiple times with similar levels of energy and danceability (Post Malone showing 0.48-0.53 energy levels) showing consistency in producing hits. While popularity varies slightly across tracks, most of them share similar audio profiles. They are catchy, energetic, and easy to dance to, highlighting the strong link between these musical features and chart success.

The genre comparison reveals that Pop, Hip-Hop, and Rap score highest in average popularity, reflecting their broad audience reach. All averaging around 0.48-0.65 in all categories. Genres such as Electronic and Reggaeton show particularly high energy and danceability, while Classical emphasizes their more niche appeal, averaging around 0.16-0.30 in all categories. Valence also differs widely by genre, with Reggae and Ska appearing more positive and upbeat, whereas Blues and Soundtrack lean toward lower mood values.

This scatter plot shows the relationship between danceability and energy for each genre. We can see a clear cluster of more popular genres in the high energy and high danceability area, showing a positive relationship between these three categories. Opera, classical and movie soundtracks all ranked on the lower end of popularity in other graphs, directly showing a correlation between these statistics. Childrens music seems to be an outlier, as its main focus is about angaging specifically to children through high energy, and encouraging children to move around.

The first graph, which includes all datasets, highlights how classical and opera composers such as Verdi, Puccini, and Beethoven dominate in the number of tracks due to frequent appearances and shared credits across recordings, which skews overall artist performance metrics. These artists show relatively low average popularity, energy, and danceability compared to modern performers. In contrast, the second graph removes classical and opera artists to provide a clearer picture of modern music performance, revealing artists like Drake, Chris Brown, and Future as leaders in average popularity, averaging around 0.60-66. This filtered view better reflects listener engagement with mainstream and soundtrack/ game-music artists (such as Hans Zimmer and Nobuo Uematsu), allowing for more meaningful comparisons across artists without distortion from legacy composer credits that do not represent single artist tracks.
